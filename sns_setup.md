Step 1: Create an SNS Topic

    Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

    Navigate to Simple Notification Service (SNS) from the Services menu.

    Click Topics in the left sidebar.

    Click Create topic.

    Choose Standard as the type.

    Enter a name for your topic, e.g., FileSyncAlerts.

    (Optional) Add a display name (used for SMS notifications).

    Click Create topic.

Step 2: Subscribe Your Email to the Topic

    In the SNS console, select your newly created topic.

    Click Create subscription.

    For Protocol, select Email.

    In the Endpoint field, enter the email address that should receive notifications.

    Click Create subscription.

Step 3: Confirm the Subscription

    Check your email inbox for a subscription confirmation message from AWS Notifications.

    Click the confirmation link in the email to activate the subscription.

Step 4: Get the SNS Topic ARN

    In the SNS console, open your topic.

    Copy the Topic ARN â€” it looks like:
    arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:FileSyncAlerts

    Use this ARN in your Python script or other tools to publish messages to this topic.
